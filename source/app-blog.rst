Blog
****

We need to develop a ``blog`` app of some kind.  Here are some thoughts:

  A ``block`` ``ContentModel`` is designed for a page.  A *nice* blog entry
  would probably want to use blocks of different types.  If a blog entry is a
  ``Page`` with multiple blocks - then how would we show a blog summary e.g.
  by date?
