PayPal
******

Using https://github.com/spookylukey/django-paypal, I think the *Pro (WPP)*
API requires the merchant to pay 20 pounds per month:
https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/pro

For the standard version, I think I can implement ``IPN`` AND ``PDT``.  Just
have to be careful not to credit the account twice!
