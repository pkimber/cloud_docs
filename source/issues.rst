uwsgi
=====

It seems that a new cloud server using python 3 doesn't install ``uwsgi``
correctly into the virtual environment.

Check the supervisor error log for uwsgi::

  /var/log/supervisor/uwsgi-stderr

If you get the following::

  exec: uwsgi: not found

Then::

  sudo -i -u web
  /home/web/repo/uwsgi
  . venv_uwsgi/bin/activate
  pip install uwsgi==2.0.1

The version of ``uwsgi`` can be found in
https://github.com/pkimber/salt/blob/master/uwsgi/requirements3.txt
